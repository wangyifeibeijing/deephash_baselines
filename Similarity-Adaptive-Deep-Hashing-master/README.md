### Prerequisites ###

1. Requirements for `Caffe`, `pycaffe` and `matcaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)).

2. Prerequisites for datasets.
    
    **Note:** In our experiments, we horizontally flip training images manually for data augmentation. If the size of your training data is small (< 100K, like CIFAR-10. MNIST), you should do this step.

    We also provide our flipping code in `cifar10/flip_img.m`, you can run it to handle your own datasets.

3. VGG-16 pre-trained model on ILSVC12 datasets, and save it in `caffemodels` directory.
    

### Installation ###

Enter caffe directory and download the source codes.
```Shell
    cd caffe/
```

Modify `Makefile.config` and build Caffe with following commands:
```Shell
    make all -j8
    make pycaffe
    make matcaffe
```

### Usage ###

We only supply the code to train 16-bit SADH on CIFAR-10 dataset.

We integrate train step and test step in a bash file `train.sh`, please run it as follows:
```Shell
    ./train.sh [ROOT_FOLDER] [GPU_ID]
    # ROOT_FOLDER is the root folder of image datasets, e.g. ./cifar10/
    # GPU_ID is the GPU you want to train on
```

### Resources ###

We supply CIFAR-10 dataset, which has been flipped. You can download it by following links:
